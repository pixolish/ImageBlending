  Image Blending  in iOS using Objective-C and C++ with OpenCV Integration
  
   This is a R & D project where I want to develop a selective image blending 
methodology with the help of poisson equation and also trying to modify the system using some addition of probablistic model use of Markov random Field 
to get the desire result not in the best case but also in the worst case scenario.

This project was started for the iOS application and OsX application
The computer vision library has been integreated here perfectly the OpenCV 2.4.8

The Code was written in Objective C and also C++ integration.

There are some sample images have been incorporated in this project for validation.

there is a pdf for primary best result output.

Thanks
